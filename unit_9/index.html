	<h2>STATEMENT OF FAITH</h2> 
	<p>We believe... </p><br>
	
	<ol>
		<li>
			The Scriptures, both Old and New Testament, to be the inspired Word of
			God, without error in the original writings:  to be the complete revelation of His will for the salvation of men, and the Divine and final authority for all Christian faith and life, (2 Timothy 3:16, Matthew 5:18, 2 Peter 1:21).

		</li>
		
		<li>	In one God, Creator of all things, infinitely perfect and eternally
	 		existing in three persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, (Matthew 28:18-19; 2 Corinthians 13:14, 1 Thessalonians 1:3-5; 1 Peter 1:2).
	 	</li>
		<li>	That Jesus Christ is true God and true man, having been conceived 
			of the 
	 		Holy Ghost and born of the virgin Mary.  He died for sin once, rose bodily from the dead and ascended into heaven.  He is now seated a the right of the Majesty on High as our high Priest and Advocate, (Hebrews 8:1; 9:11-14).
	 	</li>
		<li>That the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to glorify the Lord Jesus 
			Christ, and during this age to convict men, regenerate the believing sinner; indwell, guide, instruct and empower the believer for godly living and service, (Romans 8:11; John 16:7-9; Galatians 5:22-23).
		</li>
		<li>	That man was created in the image of God but fell into sin and is 
			therefore lost and only through regeneration by the Holy Spirit can salvation and spiritual lie be obtained (Romans 5:12; Titus 3:5-6).
		</li>
		<li>	That the shed blood of Jesus Christ and His resurrection provided the
		 	only ground for justification and eternal salvation for all who believe; and only such as receive Jesus Christ are born of the Holy Spirit, and thus become children of God, (Romans 5:8; 1 Peter 3:18; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Ephesians 1:13, 14).
		 </li>
		<li>	That a person who genuinely exercises faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is
			eternally saved.  There is absolutely no possibility of such a one losing his salvation.  God, however, chastens and corrects His disobedient children in His infinite love, (John 5:24; 10:28; Romans 8:20-30; 1 Corinthians 11:23-24; Hebrews 12:5-11).
		</li>
